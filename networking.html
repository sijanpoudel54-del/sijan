  <h1>Computer Networking</h1>

  <p>Networking allows computers and other devices to communicate, share resources, and exchange data efficiently. Networks form the backbone of modern communication, from small offices to the global internet.</p>
 



   



  <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>LAN (Local Area Network)</b> – Covers a small geographic area like an office, school, or home.</li>
    <li><b>WAN (Wide Area Network)</b> – Covers a large geographic area, connecting cities, countries, or continents.</li>
    <li><b>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</b> – Covers a city or a large campus.</li>
    <li><b>PAN (Personal Area Network)</b> – Connects personal devices like phones, laptops, and tablets within a short range.</li>
    <li><b>CAN (Campus Area Network)</b> – Connects multiple buildings within a campus.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Networking Devices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Router</b> – Directs data packets between networks and provides internet access.</li>
    <li><b>Modem</b> – Connects your network to your Internet Service Provider.</li>
    <li><b>Switch</b> – Connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data efficiently.</li>
    <li><b>Hub</b> – Connects devices in a network but broadcasts data to all devices.</li>
    <li><b>Access Point</b> – Extends wireless network coverage.</li>
    <li><b>Firewall</b> – Protects the network by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Networking Protocols</h2>
  <p>Protocols are rules that define how data is transmitted and received over a network:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>TCP/IP</b> – Standard protocol for internet communication.</li>
    <li><b>HTTP/HTTPS</b> – Protocols for web browsing.</li>
    <li><b>FTP</b> – Protocol for transferring files.</li>
    <li><b>SMTP/POP3/IMAP</b> – Protocols for email transmission and retrieval.</li>
    <li><b>DNS</b> – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Benefits of Networking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Resource Sharing – Printers, files, and internet connections can be shared.</li>
    <li>Communication – Enables instant messaging, video calls, and emails.</li>
    <li>Data Management – Centralized storage and backup.</li>
    <li>Remote Access – Users can access the network from anywhere.</li>
    <li>Cost Efficiency – Sharing resources reduces hardware and software costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Internet</h2>
  <p>The internet is a global network that connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks. It allows for communication, access to information, online services, social media, and e-commerce.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Computer networking is essential for modern computing, enabling devices to communicate, share resources, and connect to the global internet. Understanding networking is fundamental for both everyday users and IT professionals.</p>
